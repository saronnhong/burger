# Eat-Da-Burger

## Overview
Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that allows the user to input the name of burgers that they would like to eat. Each burger in the waiting area has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. All burgers are stored in MySQL database.

## Usage
Eat-Da-Burger app is deployed on Heroku. User must go to [link to heroku] to view the app. This will load the homepage which will allow the user to submit a burger's name from the input field. Once the user submits a name, it will appear on the left side. If the user selects the Devour button, the burger will be eaten and moved to the right side.
